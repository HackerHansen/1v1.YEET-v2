# 1v1.YEET-v2
An improved Cheat Engine hack for the game 1v1.lol 

### Current Status: Working (last checked February 7th, 2021)

### Note: This has only been tested on Windows 10 64-bit but may work on other versions of Windows. Support for other operating systems is not planned. This has also only been tested on Firefox. Also, having Badlion Client installed may cause Cheat Engine to not work. 

## INSTRUCTIONS: 

1.) Download Cheat Engine from https://cheatengine.org/ 

If you already have cheat engine, update to version 7.2 

*Cheat Engine tends to bundle useless bundleware, so make sure you read the installation window and make sure you are installing only Cheat Engine and not anything else if you don't want bundleware.*

2.) (Optional) Download Firefox from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ 

3.) Download and run "1v1.YEET_v2.CETRAINER" 

4.) Open a SINGLE tab to [1v1.lol](https://1v1.lol) in your browser. Make sure it is the only tab running. 

5.) If you are using Firefox, you can use the auto attachment mode. Simply press "attach process" to attach. 

6.) Enable the features and destroy your friends at the game! 

### Manual Mode Instructions: 

1.) If you are using a browser other than Firefox or prefer manual mode, go to Task Manager and press the "details" tab. 

*If you aren't using Firefox, you need to be using Chrome or a Chromium-based browser such as Brave for Compatibility Mode to work.*
